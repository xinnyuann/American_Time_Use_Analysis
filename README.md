# American Time Use Analysis 

## Key Practices
The project was created to reveal how Americans spend their daily life and explore the difference in time use pattern between different groups through:
 - Designing Star Schema and Data Ingestion with postgreSQL
 - Querying and compiling statstics from the [American Time Use Survey Data](https://www.bls.gov/tus/) with postgreSQL and Python
 - Applying exploratory data analysis and visualization methods 
 
The American Time Use Survey (ATUS) measures the amount of time people spend doing various activities, such as paid work, childcare, volunteering, and socializing.
